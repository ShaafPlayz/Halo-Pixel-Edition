# Halo: Pixel Edition
![gffe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e819908-de6e-4aba-b6f7-4ab0132881d3)


This is a game created entirely in Assembly Language.
I am using ```$gp``` register to simulate a screen 124 x 64 Pixels Wide

# Playing the Game
Use any MIPS simulator to open game.asm. I use ```MARS``` and ```SATURN```, both are great softwares made to simulate MISP Architecture.

# Additional information that you need to know:

 - Sometime the coin in the middle wont
   collect, just press "r" and try again it will work

 - The bullet would not penetrate the walls, but something for no 
   apparent reason it does which i have no idea why

 - If you spam press "d" or "a", it will allow it unless again for 
   no apparent reason Mars just crashes but this is rare

 - I dont think so there are any other bugs, but the coins 
   work really well like 90% of the time and all of a sudden
   one of them starts not working and I have no idea why

 - Sometimes, if you jump at the right moment and land inside
   the platform then the game would just act out and do something random
   usually this is not a restart level threat but its just annoying
